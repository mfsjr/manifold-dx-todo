# manifold-dx-todo
This app was created from create-react-app, and probably has code in it that appears in other 'ToDo MVC' apps.

The intention here is to provide the simplest possible demo of how manifold-dx can eliminate Flux boilerplate by 
inferring type information used by API's to create action constants, action objects, action creators, reducers and 
dispatch.

For building larger production apps, you should probably use some of the techniques shown 
in the manifold-dx docs: https://github.com/mfsjr/manifold-dx
